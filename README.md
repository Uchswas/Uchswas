# 👋 Hi there, I'm Uchswas Paul!

The traditional separation between development, QA, and operations teams is fading — modern software engineers are end-to-end problem solvers. I embrace that philosophy: a developer today is not just a coder but also a tester, deployer, and customer advocate.

I bring a compact, full-spectrum skill set — experienced in designing and developing full-stack applications, applying software testing and DevOps practices, and following solid coding and design principles. Alongside development, my research background helps me approach challenges analytically and deliver solutions that add lasting value to both products and organizations.

From optimizing large-scale systems to developing AI-driven tools, I’m passionate about building software that is efficient, reliable, and modular.

As a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at NC State University, I explore how technologies like AI and large language models can create scalable and pedagogically meaningful tools for modern classrooms.

Beyond research, I’ve worked with Kubernetes, software-defined networks, and AI-assisted software quality, including projects on gender-inclusive bug detection and peer-grading systems. My experience spans development, tool evaluation, and both qualitative and quantitative research.

With both industry and academic experience, I’ve built and deployed full-stack projects in production and collaborated closely with SEO and marketing teams. As a university faculty member, I’ve also taught and mentored over 1,400 students in core computer science courses — strengthening my leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills.
