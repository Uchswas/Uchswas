# Hi there, I'm Uchswas Paul!

The traditional separation between development, QA, and operations teams is fading. Modern software engineers are end-to-end problem solvers. I embrace that philosophy:  today’s developer isn’t just a coder, but also a tester, deployer, and customer advocate.

I bring a comprehensive skill set encompassing full-stack development, testing, and DevOps, grounded in strong coding and design principles. I’ve worked on AI-ML related research projects, LLM-based systems, Kubernetes, and software-defined networks. With industry and academic experience, I’ve shipped production-ready software, partnered with SEO and marketing teams, and mentored over 1,400 CS students.
